# Cloud Room

*Cloud Room* is fairly self-explanatory â€“ it is a seemingly enclosed space that clouds occupy. Its purpose in creation is to be an abstract space that in concept mirrors (what could be) the heavens. For many, it will simply serve as a fun, abstract visual.

This project is currently in progress.
